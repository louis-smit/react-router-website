This folder is for modules that could potentially be published to npm

- could be used in any Remix app
- no clue about this actual app
- no dependency on styling/tailwind etc.
- ideally has some tests

NOTE: please put them in their own folder (like they would be if the were in node_modules/[the thing]).
